# Revenue Analysis and Forecasting Using Time Series Models

This project provides a comprehensive time series analysis of business revenue from January 2018 to November 2022, focusing on forecasting and understanding the impact of promotional activities. The core objective was to develop robust predictive models that quantify the influence of discount and coupon rates on daily and monthly revenue. 


The analysis uses a dataset of 1,795 daily records, including revenue, discount rates, and coupon rates. A dual-granularity approach was adopted, examining data at both daily and monthly levels to capture short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. 



Advanced statistical models, including SARIMA and SARIMAX with exogenous variables, were developed and compared. The SARIMAX model, which incorporates promotional data, demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 14.29% MAPE on daily dataâ€”a significant improvement over other models. 




Key findings confirm that both discount and coupon rates have a statistically significant positive impact on revenue, suggesting that promotional strategies effectively drive sales volume. This analysis provides actionable, data-driven insights for optimizing revenue management and promotional planning.
